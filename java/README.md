# Setup

* ```RUN EXAMPLE_AI``` 

    > open a terminal, and do ```chmod +x run_game.sh && ./run_game.sh```
    
* ```IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN AI``` 

    > modify ```example_ai.java```, and then ```./run_game.sh``` to test it out!
    
* ```MODIFY OUR GAME API``` 

    > If you find our api does not have everything you need, you are more than welcome to modify it!
    > To do so, modify source code in ```src```, 
    > and then you can use ```chmod +x build_jar.sh && ./build_jar.sh``` to create your own game api jar package.
