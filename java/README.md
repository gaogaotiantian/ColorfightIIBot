# Setup

* ```RUN EXAMPLE_AI``` 

    > open a terminal, and do ```chmod +x run_game.sh && ./run_game.sh```
    
* ```IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN AI``` 

    > modify ```example_ai.java```, and then ```./run_game.sh``` to test it out!
    
    > if you are an IDE guy and do not like my script:( , you can add ```colorfightII.jar``` as an external library in your IDE.
    
* ```MODIFY OUR GAME API``` 

    > make sure you download ```maven``` if you haven't.

    > If you find our api does not have everything you need, you are more than welcome to modify it!
    > To do so, modify source code in ```src```, 
    > and then you can use ```chmod +x build_jar.sh && ./build_jar.sh``` to create your own game api jar package.
    
    > if you are an IDE guy and ```do not want to pacakge to a jar``` or ```do not like my script:(```, you can open our project in your IDE as a ```MAVEN``` project, and then create a ```main class``` under ```src/main/java/colorfightII```. Then run your main directly inside your IDE.
